# Filenet-Event-Action-Handler-Impl

This is an assignment I received from IBM. I had 1 week to complete this assignment, I believe the main focus was to show my ability to work with new documentation. Furthermore, to demonstrate my ability to work with new technologies and frameworks, since I was provided Filenet jar file and documentation and was given a week to finish this task.
